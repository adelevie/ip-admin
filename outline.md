2. January 13:  Appointments of Officials and Formation of the Agencies, Constitutional and Statutory Concerns
  
  a. The Trade-Mark Cases, 100 U.S. 82 (1879)

    > The Trade-Mark Cases, 100 U.S. 82 (1879), were a set of three cases consolidated into a single appeal before the United States Supreme Court, which in 1879 ruled that the Copyright Clause of the Constitution gave Congress no power to protect or regulate trademarks. 100 U.S. 82 (1879). Congress then passed the Trade Mark Act of 1881, which was based on the Commerce Clause power, and therefore passed constitutional muster. 

    > The cases below were United States v. Steffens, United States v. Wittemean, and United States v. Johnson. The first two cases dealt with alleged counterfeiting of marks associated with champagne. The third dealt with alleged counterfeiting of a mark associated with whiskey.

  b. Free Enterprise Fund Public Company Accounting Oversight Board, 130 S.Ct. 3138 (2010), section V of majority opinion 

> Petitioners raise three more challenges to the Board under the Appointments Clause. None has merit.
First, petitioners argue that Board members are principal officers requiring Presidential appointment with the Senate's advice and consent. We held in Edmond v. United States , 520 U. S. 651, 662-663 (1997), that "[w]hether one is an `inferior' officer depends on whether he has a superior," and that "`inferior officers' are officers whose work is directed and supervised at some level" by other officers appointed by the President with the Senate's consent. In particular, we noted that "[t]he power to remove officers" at will and without cause "is a powerful tool for control" of an inferior. Id. , at 664. As explained above, the statutory restrictions on the Commission's power to remove Board members are unconstitutional and void. Given that the Commission is properly viewed, under the Constitution, as possessing the power to remove Board members at will, and given the Commission's other oversight authority, we have no hesitation in concluding that under Edmond the Board members are inferior officers whose appointment Congress may permissibly vest in a "Hea[d] of Department]."
But, petitioners argue, the Commission is not a "Department]" like the "Executive departments" ( e.g. , State, Treasury, Defense) listed in 5 U.S.C. § 101. In Freytag , 501 U. S., at 887, n. 4, we specifically reserved the question whether a "principal agenc[y], such as . . . the Securities and Exchange Commission," is a "Department]" under the Appointments Clause. Four Justices, however, would have concluded that the Commission is indeed such a "Department]," see id. , at 918 (SCALIA, J., concurring in part and concurring in judgment), because it is a "free standing, self-contained entity in the Executive Branch," id. , at 915.
Respondents urge us to adopt this reasoning as to those entities not addressed by our opinion in Freytag , see Brief for United States 37-39; PCAOB Brief 30-33, and we do. Respondents' reading of the Appointments Clause is consistent with the common, near-contemporary definition of a "department" as a "separate allotment or part of business; a distinct province, in which a class of duties are allotted to a particular person." 3163 1 N. Webster, American Dictionary of the English Language (1828) (def. 2) (1995 facsimile ed.). 3163 It is also consistent with the early practice of Congress, which in 1792 authorized the Postmaster General to appoint "an assistant, and deputy postmasters, at all places where such shall be found necessary," § 3, 1 Stat. 234 -- thus treating him as the "Hea[d] of [a] Departmen[t]" without the title of Secretary or any role in the President's Cabinet. And it is consistent with our prior cases, which have never invalidated an appointment made by the head of such an establishment. See Freytag , supra , at 917; [735] cf. Burnap v. United States , 252 U. S. 512, 515 (1920); United States v. Germaine , 99 U. S. 508, 511 (1879). Because the Commission is a freestanding component of the Executive Branch, not subordinate to or contained within any other such component, it constitutes a "Departmen[t]" for the purposes of the Appointments Clause.[fn11]
But petitioners are not done yet. They argue that the full Commission cannot constitutionally appoint Board members, because only the Chairman of the Commission is the Commission's "Hea[d]."[fn12] The Commission's powers, however, are generally vested in the Commissioners jointly, not the Chairman alone. See, e.g. , 15 U.S.C. §§ 77s, 77t, 78u, 78w. The Commissioners do not report to the Chairman, who exercises administrative and executive functions subject to the full Commission's policies. See Reorg. Plan No. 10 of 1950, § 1(b)(1) , 64 Stat. 1265 . The Chairman is also appointed from among the Commissioners by the President alone, id . , § 3 , at 1266, which means that he cannot be regarded as "the head of an agency" for purposes of the Reorganization Act. See 5 U.S.C. § 904. (The Commission as a whole, on the other hand, does meet the requirements of the Act, including its provision that "the head of an agency [may] be an individual or a com mission or board with more than one member.")[fn13]
3164 As a constitutional matter, we see no reason why a multimember body may not be the "Hea[d]" of a "Department]" that it governs. The Appointments Clause necessarily contemplates collective appointments by the "Courts of Law," Art. II, 3164 § 2 , cl. 2, and each House of Congress, too, appoints its officers collectively, see Art. I, § 2 , cl. 5; id . , § 3 , cl. 5. Petitioners argue that the Framers vested the nomination of principal officers in the President to avoid the perceived evils of collective appointments, but they reveal no similar concern with respect to inferior officers, whose appointments may be vested elsewhere, including in multimember bodies. Practice has also sanctioned the appointment of inferior officers by multimember agencies. See Freytag, supra , at 918 ( [736] SCALIA, J., concurring in part and concurring in judgment); see also Classification Act of 1923, ch. 265, § 2, 42 Stat. 1488 (defining "the head of the department" to mean "the officer or group of officers . . . who are not subordinate or responsible to any other officer of the department" (emphasis added)); 37 Op. Atty. Gen. 227, 231 (1933) (endorsing collective appointment by the Civil Service Commission). We conclude that the Board members have been validly appointed by the full Commission.
In light of the foregoing, petitioners are not entitled to broad injunctive relief against the Board's continued operations. But they are entitled to declaratory relief sufficient to ensure that the reporting requirements and auditing standards to which they are subject will be enforced only by a constitutional agency accountable to the Executive. See Bowsher , 478 U. S., at 727, n. 5 (concluding that a separation of powers violation may create a "here-and-now" injury that can be remedied by a court (internal quotation marks omitted)).

The Constitution that makes the President accountable to the people for executing the laws also gives him the power to do so. That power includes, as a general matter, the authority to remove those who assist him in carrying out his duties. Without such power, the President could not be held fully accountable for discharging his own responsibilities; the buck would stop somewhere else. Such diffusion of authority "would greatly diminish the intended and necessary responsibility of the chief magistrate himself." The Federalist No. 70, at 478.
While we have sustained in certain cases limits on the President's removal power, the Act before us imposes a new type of restriction -- two levels of protection from removal for those who nonetheless exercise significant executive power. Congress cannot limit the President's authority in this way.
The judgment of the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit is affirmed in part and reversed in part, and the case is remanded for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.
It is so ordered.

  c. John F. Duffy, Are Administrative Patent Judges Constitutional?, 2007 Patently-O Patent L.J. 21 (2007) http://www.patentlyo.com/lawjournal/files/Duffy.BPAI.pdf 

  > Under 35 U.S.C. § 6, administrative patent judges of the Board of Patent Appeals and Interferences (BPAI) are appointed by the Director of the Patent and Trademark Office (PTO). That method of appointment is almost certainly unconstitutional, and the administrative patent judges serving under such appointments are likely to be viewed by the courts as having no constitutionally valid governmental authority.

  > Furthermore, during judicial review of the Board’s decisions, Article III courts are required to afford the decisions of the Board a substantial degree of deference under the Administrative Procedure Act. See Dickinson v. Zurko, 527 U.S. 150 (1999). The power to reach a final administrative decision — one that the courts are required to respect with deference — surely means that the members of the BPAI are exercising significant authority under the law and are thus officers for purposes of the Appointments Clause.
  
  > Because the PTO Director is not the President or a court of law, the validity of the appointment process turns on whether the Director can be viewed as a “Head of Department.”

  d. Intercollegiate Broadcasting System v. Copyright Royalty Board, 684 F.3d 1332 (D.C. Cir. 2012)

  - https://www.casetext.com/case/intercollegiate-broad-sys-inc-v-copyright-royalty-bd/

  > We hold that without the unrestricted ability to remove the Copyright Royalty Judges, Congress's vesting of their appointment in the Librarian rather than in the President violates the Appointments Clause. Accordingly we invalidate and sever the portion of the statute limiting the Librarian's ability to remove the Judges. Because the Board's structure was unconstitutional at the time it issued its determination, we vacate and remand the determination and do not address Intercollegiate's arguments regarding the merits of the rates set therein.

  e. 5 USC 3345

  - https://www.casetext.com/statute/5-usc-3345

  > (a) If an officer of an Executive agency (including the Executive Office of the President, and other than the Government Accountability Office) whose appointment to office is required to be made by the President, by and with the advice and consent of the Senate, dies, resigns, or is otherwise unable to perform the functions and duties of the office—

  f. 35 USC 6

  - https://www.casetext.com/statute/35-usc-6

  > (b) Duties.—

    The Patent Trial and Appeal Board shall—

    (1) on written appeal of an applicant, review adverse decisions of examiners upon applications for patents pursuant to section 134(a);

    (2) review appeals of reexaminations pursuant to section 134(b);

    (3) conduct derivation proceedings pursuant to section 135; and

    (4) conduct inter partes reviews and post-grant reviews pursuant to chapters 31 and 32.

  g. Aharonian v. Gutierrez, 524 F. Supp. 54 (D.D.C. 2007)

  - https://casetext.com/case/aharonian-v-gutierrez/

  > Plaintiffs complain that the appointment of Margaret Peterlin to the position of Deputy Under Secretary of Commerce for Intellectual Property and Deputy Director of the United States Patent and Trademark Office is unlawful because she is not a "citizen of the United States who has a professional background and experience in patent, or trademark law." 35 U.S.C. § 3(b). Defendant responds that, for a variety of reasons, this complaint is nonjusticiable. I agree with defendant, and will dismiss the complaint.

  h. Patlex Corp. v. Mossinghoff, 758 F.2d 594 (Fed. Cir. 1985)

  - https://casetext.com/case/patlex-corp-v-mossinghoff/

  > The issue is whether certain provisions of the patent reexamination statute and implementing regulations are in violation of: the due process clause of the Fifth Amendment to the Constitution; 1 the jury trial guarantee of the Seventh Amendment; 2 Article III which vests judicial power in the courts of the United States; or the statutory mandate of Congress. 

  - Property Rights
  - Fifth Amendment

  > In summary, we affirm the decision of the district court that 35 U.S.C. Secs. 301-307, as applied retroactively to Gould's issued patents, do not violate the Fifth Amendment or the Seventh Amendment or Article III; that 35 U.S.C. Sec. 282 does not apply to reexamination; and that MPEP Sec. 2286 does not violate statutory and constitutional restraints. The decision of the district court that 37 C.F.R. Secs. 1.26(c) and 1.530(a), and those portions of MPEP Secs. 2240 and 2244 that impose a rule of doubt on the decision to reexamine, do not violate statutory and constitutional restraints is vacated in view of Gould's lack of standing to raise these issues.
